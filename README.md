# Tic Tac Toe

For this one day project, James Bowler and I worked together on producing a tic tac toe game.

Whilst doing so, we have refactored code from object oriented programming into stateful components using hooks.

## Component Tree

- App
  - Game
    - Board
      - Square

## Instructions

If git cloning, please do an NPM install in your terminal.

## Future Goals

- Improve styling including making it responsive and the general UX/UI of the game.
- Deploy the game.
